# Elementor Conditions
Elementor's condition system has awesome condition statement. You can set a relation between two conditions and there are many compare operator. Use of Elementor's condition system is a little bit complicated but it will be easy if you think in a cool head. you can use multiple conditions for one control and I like this fact very much.

Relation:-
relation between two condition can be set by ['or'] and ['and'].default value is ['and'].

Compare Operators:- 
[ '==', '!=', '!==', 'in', '!in', '<', '<=', '>', '>=', '===' ].
default operator value ['===']. ['in', '!in'] this two operator use to find array key exist in it or not.
