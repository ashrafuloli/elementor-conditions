# elementor-conditions
Elementor's condition system has awesome condition statement. You can set a relation between two conditions and there are many compare operator. Use of Elementor's condition system is a little bit complicated but it will be easy if you think in a cool head. you can use multiple conditions for one control and I like this fact very much.
